# encode-x
Infinite base encoder/decoder. Can handle bases up to full 64 bit floating points.

```javascript
const C = require('encode-x')();

C.from10To16("16")                        // 'f'
C.from16To64("16")                        // 'P'
C.from10to64("63")                        // '/'
C.from10to65000("125")                    // '¿'
C.fromUTF8To666("The devil says, SICK!")  // '½Ǥɰ:ɧźaM)ûȭǉĎʍ9ĿƢȷ'
C.from666ToUTF8('½Ǥɰ:ɧźaM)ûȭǉĎʍ9ĿƢȷ')    // 'The devil says, SICK!'
```

As you can tell, the module works for all bases and uses a Proxy to capture the methods, they are not actually all defined on the prototype.

The core algorithm uses modular division and bitshifting exponentiation logic applied directly to buffer streams. It is from my experience
the only working full base conversion module that actually works and scales. Also, for the most part, the code is completely original.

# Features

**1.)** In built alphabets, up to base 65411 by default.

**2.)** `setGlobalAlphabet`, `setFromAlphabet`, `setToAlphabet`, and `resetAlphabets` API for ease.

**3.)** Ability to parse text data to and from.

**4.)** Ability to encode and decode streems of pure 0's. (usually lost data in encodings).

**5.)** Ability to encode and from seperate alphabets respectivly.

**6.)** Using the above feature we can swap from alphabet 1 to 2 using `from10To10` for example (with diff alphabets).

The above code snippet illustrates how simple it would be to execute the encoder, you may also call it directly without the `new` keyword.

```javascript
C = require('./encode-x')(/* [from alphabet], [to alphabet] */).fromXXXtoXXX(data) 
     
      /* OR */

C = require('./encode-x')
C.setToAlphabet = C.setFromAlphabet = "1234567890abcdefgahiklm"
C.from10to999(data) // Error is thrown because your to alphabet cannot is to small for base999.
     
```
